# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Next.js application is experiencing hydration errors where the server-rendered HTML doesn't match the client-side React rendering. The error specifically mentions a mismatch with a `<header>` element, but the root cause is likely related to components that have different initial states between server and client rendering, particularly around font loading and dynamic content generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to render consistently between server and client, so that users don't experience hydration errors and the app loads smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the server-rendered HTML SHALL match the client-side React rendering exactly
2. WHEN components use client-side state THEN they SHALL initialize with the same values on both server and client
3. WHEN font loading occurs THEN it SHALL not cause hydration mismatches
4. WHEN dynamic content is generated THEN it SHALL be consistent between server and client rendering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the font preview and page estimation features to work without causing rendering errors, so that I can use the application reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the font loading hook initializes THEN it SHALL start with a consistent state on both server and client
2. WHEN page count estimation runs THEN it SHALL not cause hydration mismatches during initial render
3. WHEN components depend on browser APIs THEN they SHALL handle server-side rendering gracefully
4. WHEN dynamic calculations occur THEN they SHALL be deferred until after hydration is complete

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent future hydration issues, so that the application remains stable as new features are added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new components are added THEN they SHALL follow patterns that prevent hydration mismatches
2. WHEN client-side state is used THEN it SHALL be properly synchronized between server and client
3. WHEN browser APIs are accessed THEN they SHALL be wrapped in proper client-side checks
4. WHEN dynamic content is rendered THEN it SHALL use consistent initial states
