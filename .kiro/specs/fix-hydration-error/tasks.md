# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create hydration-safe utility hook
  - Create a new hook `useHydrationSafe` that ensures consistent initial states between server and client
  - Implement proper client-side detection and state synchronization
  - Add TypeScript interfaces for hydration state management
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1, 3.3_

- [x] 2. Fix font loading hook hydration issues
  - Update `useFontLoader` to start with consistent 'hydrating' state on both server and client
  - Add proper client-side checks before accessing browser APIs like `document` and `FontFace`
  - Implement deferred font loading that happens after hydration completes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 2.1, 2.3_

- [x] 3. Update font state hook for hydration safety
  - Modify `useFontState` to use the new hydration-safe pattern
  - Ensure font status remains consistent during initial render
  - Add proper loading state management that doesn't cause hydration mismatches
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Fix PreviewSection component hydration
  - Update PreviewSection to render static content during initial render
  - Defer dynamic font styling until after hydration completes
  - Remove conditional rendering that depends on client-side state during initial render
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 5. Fix PageCountPreview component hydration
  - Update PageCountPreview to show placeholder content during initial render
  - Defer page count estimation until after hydration using the hydration-safe hook
  - Ensure loading states are consistent between server and client
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Add client-side checks to browser API usage
  - Wrap all `document`, `window`, and other browser API calls with proper client-side checks
  - Implement fallback behavior for server-side rendering scenarios
  - Update font utilities to handle SSR gracefully
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 7. Test hydration fixes
  - Create unit tests to verify components render consistently on server and client
  - Test font loading behavior in SSR environment
  - Verify page count estimation works without hydration errors
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [ ] 8. Validate complete hydration flow
  - Test the entire application for hydration errors
  - Verify all components work correctly after the fixes
  - Check that dynamic features still function properly after hydration
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.4_
