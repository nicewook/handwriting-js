# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing PDF handwriting practice sheet generator to support multi-page PDF generation. Currently, the system generates only a single page with limited text content. The enhancement will allow users to generate comprehensive handwriting practice sheets with full text content distributed across multiple pages (up to 50 pages maximum), enabling extended practice sessions with complete literary works or longer text passages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user practicing handwriting, I want to generate multi-page PDF practice sheets so that I can practice with complete text content without being limited to a single page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text content that exceeds one page capacity THEN the system SHALL automatically distribute the content across multiple pages
2. WHEN generating a multi-page PDF THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent formatting and guideline spacing across all pages
3. WHEN the text content requires more than 50 pages THEN the system SHALL limit the output to 50 pages maximum and truncate remaining content
4. WHEN generating multiple pages THEN each page SHALL contain the same 4-zone guideline system as the current single-page implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the maximum number of pages in my practice sheet so that I can customize the length based on my practice needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the PDF generation interface THEN the system SHALL provide a page limit control with options from 1 to 50 pages
2. WHEN a user sets a page limit THEN the system SHALL respect this limit and distribute available text content within the specified number of pages
3. WHEN the selected text content is less than the page limit THEN the system SHALL generate only the necessary number of pages
4. WHEN no page limit is specified THEN the system SHALL default to generating all necessary pages up to the 50-page maximum

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see page numbers on my multi-page practice sheets so that I can keep track of my progress and organize my practice sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating a multi-page PDF THEN the system SHALL add page numbers to each page
2. WHEN displaying page numbers THEN they SHALL be positioned at the bottom center of each page
3. WHEN generating a single page PDF THEN page numbers SHALL be optional or omitted
4. WHEN page numbers are displayed THEN they SHALL use the format "Page X of Y" where X is current page and Y is total pages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the text distribution across pages to be intelligent so that sentences and paragraphs are not awkwardly split across page boundaries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN distributing text across pages THEN the system SHALL prioritize keeping complete sentences on the same page
2. WHEN a sentence cannot fit on the current page THEN the system SHALL move the entire sentence to the next page
3. WHEN distributing text THEN the system SHALL maintain proper spacing between text blocks
4. WHEN text wrapping occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve the original text formatting and structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview how many pages my selected text will generate so that I can make informed decisions about my practice session length.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects text content and font size THEN the system SHALL display an estimated page count
2. WHEN the estimated page count exceeds the user's page limit THEN the system SHALL show a warning message
3. WHEN text content changes THEN the page count estimate SHALL update automatically
4. WHEN the page count estimate is displayed THEN it SHALL be accurate within Â±1 page of the actual generated PDF

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the multi-page PDF generation to maintain the same performance and reliability as the current single-page system so that I can generate longer practice sheets without delays or errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating multi-page PDFs THEN the system SHALL complete generation within 30 seconds for up to 50 pages
2. WHEN PDF generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
3. WHEN generating large PDFs THEN the system SHALL maintain memory efficiency and not cause browser crashes
4. WHEN the generated PDF is downloaded THEN the file size SHALL be optimized and reasonable for the content length
